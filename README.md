After creating apps to help solve the New York Times Letter Boxed and Spelling Bee word games, I decided I should go ahead and complete the list and design a Wordle solution app.

As I begin this app, my intention is to create a solution helper that will emulate the look of Wordle and give suggestions based upon the given letters.

I plan on using the 5x6 grid layout and as a player enters a word on Wordle and receives feedback on individual letters, they will be able to enter the letters here and then by clicking the box of an individual letter indicate if the letter is included in the word, in the right position, or not.

My algorithm will be written to search based upon the priority given to specific letters and their placement. 

This is the beginning of this endeavor that is just an end of day coding project to help me maintain and sharpen my React, JavaScript and general coding skills.

We shall see where this journey takes me. And perhaps us if you come along for the ride!
